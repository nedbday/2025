			<h3>Abstract</h3>
			<p>
				There are three major developments that indicate the traditional way of building data-oriented applications
				can be improved substantially. First, the aggressive movement of applications to the cloud is being done by
				all enterprises who can. Pricing by the cloud vendors dramatically favors a workflow paradigm, not the
				traditional client-server model. Second, domain-specific languages, long popular for business data
				processing applications, must be changed to work well for a workflow paradigm. This presents an opportunity
				for new domain specific languages (DSPs). Lastly, the scale requirements of web applications is putting
				extreme stress on Linux, again leading to the desirability of a new system software stack. This paper shows
				how the traditional development paradigm can be improved for data-oriented applications by leveraging these
				new features, thereby obtaining significantly reduced development time and cloud costs, simpler
				administration and better security.

			Dr. Stonebraker has been a pioneer of data base research and technology for more than forty years. He was
			the main architect of the INGRES relational DBMS, and the object-relational DBMS, POSTGRES. These prototypes
			were developed at the University of California at Berkeley where Stonebraker was a Professor of Computer
			Science for twenty-five years. More recently at M.I.T. he was the co-architect of the C-Store column-
			oriented DBMS, the H-Store transaction processing engine, the Data Tamer data integration system, the SciDB
			array processing engine, the Kyrix visualization system and the operating system DBOS. He is the founder of
			ten venture-capital backed startups which have commercialized his prototypes.
			Professor Stonebraker is the author of scores of research papers on data base technology, operating systems
			and the architecture of system software services. He was awarded the ACM System Software Award in 1992, for
			his work on INGRES. Additionally, he was awarded the first annual Innovation award by the ACM SIGMOD special
			interest group in 1994 and was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1997. He was awarded the
			IEEE John Von Neumann award in 2005, and the ACM Turing Award in 2014. Presently he is an Adjunct Professor
			of Computer Science at M.I.T., where he is working on a variety of future-generation data-oriented projects.

		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<!--p>
			This talk will take an in depth look at the architecture of InfluxDB 3, a distributed real-time, time series
			database that uses object store as its historical durability layer. I'll cover the specific components and
			design considerations on separating ingestion from compaction from query workloads. We'll also look at some
			of the challenges encountered when building a database on top of object storage that requires sub-second
			query response times with immediate read-your-writes capability.

		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<!--
		<p>
			In this talk I will present our work with TileDB, which I created when I was at MIT and Intel Labs and then
			spun out into its own company (which has raised over $55M to day and counts 75 talented individuals). TileDB
			is an adaptive database, which morphs to capture all the complex data and complex compute required to solve
			challenging data & AI problems in numerous applications, all in a single product and with maximum
			performance and simplicity. It is architected around multi-dimensional arrays, a powerful data structure
			that shape-shifts to efficiently model all the diverse data of your applications. It also offers vertical
			functionality for a broad set of challenging application domains. Finally, TileDB is enterprise-grade and
			has security as a top priority, guaranteeing high-standard governance and compliance. The talk will also
			cover the challenges we faced and the amazing customer problems we have solved.
