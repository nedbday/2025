		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>
			There are three major developments that indicate the traditional way of building data-oriented applications
			can be improved substantially. First, the aggressive movement of applications to the cloud is being done by
			all enterprises who can. Pricing by the cloud vendors dramatically favors a workflow paradigm, not the
			traditional client-server model. Second, domain-specific languages, long popular for business data
			processing applications, must be changed to work well for a workflow paradigm. This presents an opportunity
			for new domain specific languages (DSPs). Lastly, the scale requirements of web applications is putting
			extreme stress on Linux, again leading to the desirability of a new system software stack. This paper shows
			how the traditional development paradigm can be improved for data-oriented applications by leveraging these
			new features, thereby obtaining significantly reduced development time and cloud costs, simpler
			administration and better security.

			Dr. Stonebraker has been a pioneer of data base research and technology for more than forty years. He was
			the main architect of the INGRES relational DBMS, and the object-relational DBMS, POSTGRES. These prototypes
			were developed at the University of California at Berkeley where Stonebraker was a Professor of Computer
			Science for twenty-five years. More recently at M.I.T. he was the co-architect of the C-Store column-
			oriented DBMS, the H-Store transaction processing engine, the Data Tamer data integration system, the SciDB
			array processing engine, the Kyrix visualization system and the operating system DBOS. He is the founder of
			ten venture-capital backed startups which have commercialized his prototypes.
			Professor Stonebraker is the author of scores of research papers on data base technology, operating systems
			and the architecture of system software services. He was awarded the ACM System Software Award in 1992, for
			his work on INGRES. Additionally, he was awarded the first annual Innovation award by the ACM SIGMOD special
			interest group in 1994 and was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1997. He was awarded the
			IEEE John Von Neumann award in 2005, and the ACM Turing Award in 2014. Presently he is an Adjunct Professor
			of Computer Science at M.I.T., where he is working on a variety of future-generation data-oriented projects.

		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<!--p>
			This talk will take an in depth look at the architecture of InfluxDB 3, a distributed real-time, time series
			database that uses object store as its historical durability layer. I'll cover the specific components and
			design considerations on separating ingestion from compaction from query workloads. We'll also look at some
			of the challenges encountered when building a database on top of object storage that requires sub-second
			query response times with immediate read-your-writes capability.

		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>
			Serverless architectures are reshaping data systems by delivering new standards of scalability, efficiency,
			and simplicity. Drawing on production insights from running Astra Serverless DB at scale, this keynote
			identifies the core principles that underpin the design and management of most serverless data platforms.
			These principles enable adaptable solutions that support diverse data formats, indexing strategies, and
			analytical approaches while minimizing complexity. Ultimately, this talk provides both conceptual clarity
			and practical guidance for those seeking to build next-generation, serverless DBAAS and PAAS systems for
			thousands of developers across all cloud platforms.
