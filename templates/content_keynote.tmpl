	  <h2>1) Novel Applications for Large Language Models in Data Management<br>
		<p><a href="http://www.itrummer.org" target="_blank">Immanuel Trummer</a> &nbsp; <small>Cornell University</small></p> </h2>


		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>
			The past years have been marked by several breakthrough results in the domain of generative AI, culminating in the rise of tools like ChatGPT, able to solve a variety of language-related tasks without specialized training. In this talk, I outline novel opportunities in the context of data management, enabled by these advances. I discuss several recent research projects at Cornell, aimed at exploiting advanced language processing for tasks such as parsing text about databases and data sets to support automated index selection, parameter tuning, or data profiling, mining data for patterns, described in natural language, or synthesizing scenario-specific code for data processing via specialized coding assistants. Finally, I discuss recent projects, aimed at scaling up the analysis of multimodal data via large language models to large repositories.

	  <h2>2) The Architecture of InfluxDB 3: A Distributed, Real-time Database on Object Storage<br>
		<p><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/pauldix" target="_blank">Paul Dix</a> &nbsp; <small>InfluxDB</small></p> </h2>


		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>
			This talk will take an in depth look at the architecture of InfluxDB 3, a distributed real-time, time series database that uses object store as its historical durability layer. I'll cover the specific components and design considerations on separating ingestion from compaction from query workloads. We'll also look at some of the challenges encountered when building a database on top of object storage that requires sub-second query response times with immediate read-your-writes capability.

	  <h2>3) The Adaptive Database<br>
		<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stavrospap/" target="_blank">Stavros Papadopoulos</a> &nbsp; <small>TileDB</small></p> </h2>


		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>
			In this talk I will present our work with TileDB, which I created when I was at MIT and Intel Labs and then spun out into its own company (which has raised over $55M to day and counts 75 talented individuals). TileDB is an adaptive database, which morphs to capture all the complex data and complex compute required to solve challenging data & AI problems in numerous applications, all in a single product and with maximum performance and simplicity. It is architected around multi-dimensional arrays, a powerful data structure that shape-shifts to efficiently model all the diverse data of your applications. It also offers vertical functionality for a broad set of challenging application domains. Finally, TileDB is enterprise-grade and has security as a top priority, guaranteeing high-standard governance and compliance. The talk will also cover the challenges we faced and the amazing customer problems we have solved.
